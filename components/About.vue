                Hi! I am Nikita Galuh, primarily a Flutter Developer based in Slovenia. My interest in computer science
                and
                programming sparked in my early teens with inspiration from playing video games after school and
                relatives,
                who studied computer science. I am currently writing my diploma to graduate from University of
                Ljubljana,
                Faculty of Computer and Information Science.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify text-lg font-normal  lg:text-xl sm:px-16 xl:px-48 text-gray-200">
                My career started in the field of frontend web development, specifically by making simple WordPress
                websites
                and later progressing to Django and Laravel. By the end of high school I started taking interest in
                mobile
                development and developed my first Android application, which was a simple app for displaying a
                student's
                schedule. Since August 2022 I am actively working in the field of mobile development, starting with
                Kotlin and
                now primarily working with Flutter. I occasionally provide other services, such as maintenance and
                development
                of WordPress websites, editing content for electronic handbooks and web design.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-justify text-lg font-normal  lg:text-xl sm:px-16 xl:px-48 text-gray-200">
                In my free time I enjoy playing video games, creative writing, singing, reading, creating UI designs for
                web
                and mobile applications and content creation. Due to
                my Balinese heritage, one of my personal goals is to move there for a longer period of time and have the
                opportunity to also work on some personal non-IT projects along with programming.</p>
